This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

#### Brief

"Design and build a simple javascript library that can be included in the <head> tag of
a website. The library should load itself when included on a webpage. The library
should allow a user to process a CSV file of bank transactions and produce a
personal profit and loss statement from them."

#### Tech Stack

- Next.js & Typescript
- Vite bundled Typescript library

## Improvement ideas

- Drag-and-drop CSV support
- Group income/expenses by month if transactions overlap months


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
